Barsut!

A scheme implementation is Haskell, based (very much) on
the tutorial Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours by Jonathan Tang
:: http://jonathan.tang.name/files/scheme_in_48/tutorial/overview.html ::

Build:
  -- requires ghc

Usage:
  -- ./Barsut
  -- ./Barsut <file.scm> might work too but isn't tested (and bear in mind we only support a subset of scheme!)

Things not supported that you might expect:
  -- cond (just if, sorry)
  -- let (just nested defines...)



Todos:
Add safety clauses to primitives
  -- some errors are handled, others will crash the repl

Stuff added:
begin fn
pair? fn
display fn
readline support for repl
modularizing the code
fixed curry in stdlib
made eval cps style
  -- apply doesn't keep the same continuation stack though when it evals a function body
  -- didn't get around to call/cc :(
